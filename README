You'll need the python extension ,BeautifulSoup 4.1.2, or higher
as it supports searching html's class tags

1. To run, save a page as "HTML ONLY" to the same directory as main.py.
2. Edit the 'file' variable in main.py for the html file you would like to parse
    I could probably write something so it takes in urls or files
    but that comes later
3. Then just run python ./main.py
    the script will generate a pretty printed version of the html
    (if it was a file) with suffix _pretty
    it will also save output to a text file with suffix _parsed.txt
